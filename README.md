### Firstly, the user initiates a request to the country API using the fetch function, specifying a particular country. This request is triggered when the page loads, revealing initial information.

### Subsequently, as the user enters input, an "input" event handler is employed. This handler triggers another request to the API, this time incorporating the user's input value.

### Upon the user commencing input, a function compares the input and API objects. As a result, "option" elements are dynamically generated, and elements that match are added inside.

### Upon clicking the input field, the application displays detailed information about the selected country.
