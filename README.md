Firstly, the user initiates a request to the country API using the fetch function, specifying a particular country. This request is triggered when the page loads, revealing initial information.
Subsequently, as the user enters input, an "input" event handler is employed. This handler triggers another request to the API, this time incorporating the user's input value.
Upon the user commencing input, a function compares the input and API objects. As a result, "option" elements are dynamically generated, and elements that match are added inside.Upon clicking the input field, the application displays detailed information about the selected country.
